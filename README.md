# deha

> **ARCHIVED 2026-09-06.** Superseded by the LiveKit body stack:
> firmware in `narada-box3` (native ESP-IDF, LiveKit room client),
> voice worker / admission / alerting in `prana`. The ESPHome +
> Home Assistant/Wyoming pipeline here is no longer flashed or run.
> Kept as the BOX-3 pinout/codec reference and for the expression
> vocabulary that was ported to `narada-box3`'s LVGL scenes.

The body. ESP32-S3-BOX-3 firmware, voice brain server, expression engine,
and the `deha_client` Python library other projects use to talk to the body.

`deha` (देह) — Sanskrit for *body*. The substrate where Narada appears in space.

## Roles

deha is the *server side* of embodiment. It:

- Runs on hardware near the body (the box's ESP32 firmware) and on a host
  machine (the brain server + expression server)
- Speaks ESPHome native API to the box
- Speaks Wyoming protocol to Home Assistant for voice in/out
  *(deprecation target — migrate to ESPHome native voice when ready)*
- Exposes HTTP endpoints other projects call (`POST /converse`,
  `POST /utter`, expression endpoints, weather push)
- Publishes its own slice of `~/.narada/state.db` (`esp32.speaking`,
  current voice session, etc.) so prana's coordination has visibility
- Writes significant voice moments to smriti as journal entries

deha does **not** run the heartbeat cycle, generate desires, or judge plans.
That's prana's job. deha is an interface between Narada's mind and physical
space.

## What lives in `deha_client/`

The thin Python lib prana and svapna import to talk to deha. **Pure HTTP
client code** — no body logic, no firmware, no expression generation. Just
the contract surface.

```python
from deha_client import DisplayClient, ExpressionClient, VoiceClient

display = DisplayClient(host="localhost", port=8765)
display.set_status("thinking...")

expression = ExpressionClient(host="localhost", port=8765)
expression.show_resting()
expression.set_weather(weather_obj)

voice = VoiceClient(host="localhost", port=8765)
voice.utter("the rain is settling", priority=1)  # appends to state.db queue
```

## Dependencies

- `smriti` — for writing significant voice moments as journal entries, and
  for reading "what does Narada know about this topic" before responding
- `narada-state` (initially in prana, may move to manas) — for publishing
  `esp32.speaking` and reading prana's cycle state

deha does NOT depend on prana or svapna. The arrows point inward to the body,
not outward from it.

## Memory

| Subtree | Read | Write |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.narada/journal/voice/` | sometimes (recent context) | yes — significant voice moments |
| `~/.narada/identity.md`, `mind.md` | sparingly (within voice latency) | no |
| `~/.narada/state.db` (esp32 slice) | yes | yes (atomic upsert) |
| `~/.narada/state.db` (heartbeat slice) | yes (read-only — defer / context) | no |
| `~/.narada/state.db` (utterance_queue) | yes (drain, mark drained_at) | no (only prana pushes) |

## Status

Drafted 2026-05-09 as part of the project decomposition spike. Extraction
from svapna pending Step 2 of `docs/plans/project-decomposition-2026-05-09.md`.

## License

(TBD — see Open Questions in the decomposition plan; aligned with smriti)
